                            <p>Hi, my name's Jenny (she/they).</p>
                            <p>I’m a qualified integrative therapist registered with the BACP.</p>

                <h1><i>My Approach</i></h1>
                <p>I'm an integrative therapist. This means that I draw on a range of theories and techniques, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Psychodynamic psychotherapy</b> 
                        <p><i>Early relationships affect our thoughts and feelings in our current relationships. By understanding your unconscious patterns, you can make changes in everyday situations.</i></p></li>
                    <li><b>Person centred therapy</b> 
                        <p><i>Putting you in the driving seat for therapy, sessions are led by what you want to work on. I provide empathy, compassion and genuineness to support you.</i></p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>I also incorporate aspects of relational therapy, somatic therapy, attachment theory and CBT.</p>
                <p>We live in a world where intersectional oppressions exist, on the grounds of race, gender, class, sexuality, religion and many more. These can have a serious impact on our mental health. The therapy relationship is no exception. I am open to exploration of any aspects of identity and difference at any point during our work together.</p>

                <h1><i>Experience</i></h1>
                <p>I have experience supporting clients through a range of difficulties, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Anxiety</li>
                        <li>Depression</li>
                        <li>Relationship challenges</li>
                        <li>Identity</li>
                        <li>Difficult family relationships</li>

                <br>
                <h1><i>LGBTQIA+ therapy</i></h1>
                <p>As a queer person I know therapy is most effective when you feel safe to bring your whole self to a session. I care deeply about LGBTQIA+ justice and equity. I welcome clients from across the gender, sexuality and relationship spectrum. Whether you want to work on issues related being LGBTQIA+ or something else entirely.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h1><i>Qualifications</i></h1>
                <p>I’m a qualified therapist with a Diploma in Therapeutic Counselling. I’m also a member of the BACP, a professional association for the counsellors and therapists in the UK.</p>
                <p>I have experience running support groups for OCD and phobias with the charity TOP UK. I’ve also worked for the national mental health charity, Mind.</p>

                <h1><i>Next Steps</i></h1>
                    <p>If you’ve decided you want to see me for therapy, please email me to book an assessment session.</p>
                    <p>In the assessment session we’ll explore what’s brought you to therapy, and what you might want to get from it. The relationship between therapist and client is important. So, it’s also an opportunity for us both to get a feel for whether we’d be a good fit. I charge £55 for an assessment session.</p>
                    <p>I’m also offer a brief 15 minute phone call if you have any questions before booking an assessment. Please email me if you’d like to arrange a call.</p>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <h1><i>Contact</i></h1>
